# Nordic Noir: Shadows Over Scandinavia in the Postwar Era

# Nordic Noir : quand les ombres de l'après-guerre planent sur la Scandinavie

The term film noir was coined in 1946 by French film critic Nino Frank, who used it to describe a set of narrative and visual traits he observed in American films that had been barred in France during the war. Over time, the study of noir expanded beyond Hollywood, encompassing films from other countries that shared similar aesthetics and themes. In the Nordic context, this gave rise to what is now known as Nordic Noir – a concept that has gained traction both in academic circles and in international marketing.

> On doit le terme de « film noir » au critique français Nino Frank, qui l'utilise dès 1946 pour décrire un ensemble de codes narratifs et visuels qu'il a pu observer dans les films américains bannis en France pendant la guerre. Au fil des ans, l'étude du film noir s'élargit au-delà de Hollywood pour désigner des œuvres d'autres pays qui en partagent les thèmes et l'esthétique. En Scandinavie, ce phénomène aboutit à ce qu'on appelle aujourd'hui le Nordic Noir, un concept à usage tant universitaire que commercial.

While crime films had long been a staple of Scandinavian cinema, the genre underwent a profound transformation during the 1940s and 1950s. Prior to this period, Nordic crime films were often lighthearted, formulaic police stories or comedic mysteries. Film production in general was influenced by German cinema, which had long served as a cultural and aesthetic model. But the devastation of World War II shattered these ties, and the cinematic gaze shifted westward – toward the war's victors, primarily the United States.

Si les films policiers ont longtemps été l'un des piliers du cinéma scandinave, le genre connaît une profonde mutation au cours des années 40 et 50. Auparavant, les polars nordiques se résumaient à des comédies policières ou d'aimables enquêtes stéréotypées. L'industrie cinématographique vivait sous l'influence. Les ravages de la Seconde Guerre mondiale ont brisé ces liens, et les regards se sont alors tournés vers l'Ouest — et principalement les États-Unis

In Denmark, the German occupation left a deep mark on national film culture. Danish films grew darker in
tone, more introspective, and increasingly focused on questions of national identity. Across Scandinavia, film
production surged during the war years – largely because foreign competition was cut off – and filmmakers
embraced a more realistic style, turning their attention to everyday dramas and pressing social issues.
The growing cultural influence of United States on postwar Scandinavia left a significant imprint on the
crime genre. The bumbling or menacing police figures of the 1920s and 1930s gave way to a new archetype
inspired by American noir – the cool, detached private eye, preferably dressed in a trench coat. The noir
sensibility – with its moral ambiguity, fatalism, and psychological depth – found fertile ground in a society
grappling with the aftermath of war and the erosion of traditional values.

When a visual culture like noir migrates to a new context, its aesthetic, political, and social dimensions are
inevitably renegotiated. In Scandinavian cinema, the tropes of American noir – chiaroscuro lighting, femme
fatales, fatalism, voice-over narration – appear more as exceptions than norms. In fact, Nordic noir often
resembles what experimental filmmaker Thom Andersen called film gris: a subgenre of socially and
politically engaged films made by blacklisted American filmmakers between 1947 and 1952. These films
tend to blame society for crime rather than the individual, a perspective that resonates strongly with the
Nordic welfare-state ethos.

Nordic noir was shaped not only by Hollywood but also by French poetic realism from the 1930s, which had
a profound impact on both crime cinema and other genres. During the early 1940s, imports from Hollywood
were blocked due to the war at sea. As a result, the somber style of early Scandinavian noir seems more
indebted to French poetic realism – a precursor to American noir. Marcel Carné's Le Quai des brumes
(1938), for instance, was a box-office hit in Scandinavia and hailed as a masterpiece in the national press.
A notable figure in this development was Danish director Bodil Ipsen, who had several successes with films
that leaned toward the noir genre. During the war years, she directed Afsporet (1942), Besættelse (1944), and
Mordets Melodi (1944) – films that explored psychological trauma, moral ambiguity, and urban alienation.
Remarkably, several of the noir films produced in Norway and Denmark during the 1940s were directed by
women. In Norway, Edith Carlmar's Døden er et kjærtegn (1949) is widely regarded as the country's first
film noir. In Denmark, alongside Ipsen, Alice O'Fredericks found success with semi-noir Hr. Petit (1948), a
chilling story about a serial killer targeting women.

Several Scandinavian films from the era explicitly reference or echo American noir classics. Lars-Eric
Kjellgren's I dimma dold (1953) includes a direct nod to Otto Preminger's Laura (1944) and Torben Anton
Svendsen's To minutter for sent (1952) opens with a sequence that clearly recalls the visual style and tension
of Joseph H. Lewis's Gun Crazy (1950). Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944) appears to have inspired
Døden er et kjærtegn, though Carlmar's focus leans more toward obsessive love than criminal conspiracy.
Meanwhile, Hasse Ekman echoes Citizen Kane (1941) in Flicka och hyacinter's (1950) narrative structure.
However, Nordic noir is generally less nihilistic and misanthropic than its American counterpart. The films
place greater emphasis on fate, emotional depth, and the influence of these forces on human action. In noir's
fatalistic universe, destiny grips the protagonist from the beginning and never lets go.

Visually, noir is defined by its striking style: threatening close-ups, unsettling camera angles, and dramatic
interplay of light and shadow create a world of instability and psychological tension. Much of the action
takes place at night, allowing rich chiaroscuro effects that bathe characters in ambiguity. Urban settings –
such as those captured by cinematographer Gunnar Fischer in I dimma dold – reinforce the atmosphere of
uncertainty and paranoia.

Noir films from Norway, Denmark, and Sweden share not only thematic and stylistic elements, but also
linguistic and cultural similarities. While each country incorporated noir elements in its own way, together
these films offer a multifaceted view of Scandinavian society in the 1940s and 1950s – a view in which
darkness is a constant presence.

After this postwar period, the noir fever in Scandinavia largely subsided. With a few notable exceptions, the
genre lay dormant for decades – until noir resurfaced around the turn of the millennium. This revival gained
international attention with films like Insomnia (1997) and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009), as well
as TV crime dramas such as The Bridge (2011) and The Killing (2007), sparking a new wave of noir that
continues to shape global perceptions of Nordic storytelling.
